TWiki Migration Tools
=====================

There is currently just a very simple and incomplete script converting TWiki
markup to AsciiDoc.

The script is just a single file when it really should have consisted of a
parser module and another one generating AsciiDoc, but even so, it should be
simple enough to add conversion to another format, e.g. Markdown, to it.
